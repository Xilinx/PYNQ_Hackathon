The Xilinx Hackathon is a 30 hour marathon event where you get to create 
custom hardware with simple software scripts. We provide a PYNQ-Z1 board and 
an assortment of Arduino®-compatible shields and sensors. PYNQ is an 
open-source project from Xilinx that makes it easy to design embedded systems 
with Xilinx Zynq All Programmable Systems on Chips. Teams of up to 4 people 
create something new and wonderful.
