# Mini Challenge 1

Long time ago, A man and his wife lived with their beautiful little daughter in a small village. 
Life as they knew was perfect, they shared a loving life with small but many happy moments.  
But soon this got changed when an old lady, who owned a BAR, moved next doors. 
She took profound interest in their daughter and started befriending her. 
One day when the parents were at work, the child was kidnapped.  
A small boy who used to play with their daughter was the sole eye-witness of the abduction. 
Unfortunately he kept on drawing a random image.

Can you help us find their daughter!
