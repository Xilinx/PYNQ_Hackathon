    "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the software offloading capabilities of the ZYNQ SoC on the PYNQ board. This application uses a modified base overlay that configures the microphone to interface indirectly, through a series of filters, to the four user LEDs. It is set up to identify tones at 1, 3, 5, and 7 kHz though these values can be defined in hardware by filter choice. This audio demodulation capability is a proof of concept for remote control (using sound waves) that does not stress the A9 core. "

    "## Command Format\n",
    "Commands are sent with a leading byte of data: b'01111110'\n",
    "Then the next byte is of the format: b'000xxxxx'\n",
    "Anything following 4 symbols after the start byte is ignored.\n",
    "    This data format allows up to 32 unique commands and protects against sending the start byte.\n",
    "Each symbol represents two bits, and is represented by one of a 1, 3, 5, or 7 kHz sine wave lasting 0.25 seconds. \n",
    "For the transmission of 16 bits = 2 bytes in 2 seconds this protocol makes 8 bits per second."

    "## Decoder Implementation\n",
    "The decoder is designed using System Generator. First the PDM signal output of the microphone is simulated. A low pass filter is applied to the PDM signal to generate an approximate waveform. This waveform is then downsampled and conditioned before the next step. The signal then passes in parallel through four separate bandpass filters corresponding to the frequency in question. This output is used at the AIX interface back to the A9 microcontroller as well as at the four user LEDs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The system generated in SG is then placed into a new copy of the base overlay, careful to supply necessary peripherals such as a clock for the microphone. This is ultimately synthesized and stored on the PYNQ as a bitstream. When the base overlay is called it properly sets the FPGA to perform the decoding."

    "\n",
    "The controller code is NOT expected to be run on the PYNQ board, though in a future iteration a PYNQ board could be configured as the transmitter."
